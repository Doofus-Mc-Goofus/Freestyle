# Freestyle
A weird YouTube Myspace Fediverse hybrid thing I'm working on. I'll add the code once the site launches publicly (or if I give up and dump it here for someone else to finish (significantly more likely))

Since the code won't be here for a while, I though I'd give a progress report in the mean time to hold y'all over.

|Feature|Status|
|-|-|
|Site Layout|✔* Done (there are still a few things I'd like to work on before launch)|
|Basic Views (Profiles, Videos, etc.)|✔* Done (still need to add some stuff once I finish the other features)|
|Video Playing|✔* Done (still need to add some stuff once I finish the other features)|
|Video Uploading|✔ Done|
|Video Metadata Editing|✔ Done|
