# Freestyle
A weird YouTube Myspace Fediverse hybrid thing I was working on. I gave up because I realized I wouldn't be able to handle a project of this scale with the resources I had available. Plus, I have a lot of problems in real life I need to prioritize over this project. Feel free to finish the code and host your own instance.

Since I never finished this project, I though I'd give a progress report to show what I could've done if I had the motivation to.
